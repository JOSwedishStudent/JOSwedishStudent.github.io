        I have made two fun projects already.
        My first project was that I created a code to draw a               smileyFace. Then i continued to work with the code so it           drawed very many SmileyFaces forever!
        See the project here: <br>

        I have another project too. It is a spin-off off the Khan          academy challange "challenge: SmileyFace". In the project          created I a code that drawed four SmileyFaces. In the code         was also a code to write what the smileyFaces said. It was also a part of the code that maked one of the SmileyFaces a little bit different... <br>
        ...he was not a SmileyFace! See the project here:
